This is the rendered output for **Homework 1** of **STAT 7510**.

```{r setup, include=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Install Packages

The first step we will do is load in the `ISLR2` package from CRAN. This provides access to the collection of data-sets used in the book 'An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R, Second Edition'.

```{r}
# Install, if necessary
#install.packages('ISLR2')

# Load in package
library(ISLR2)
```

## Preview Data

Next, we will print out the first 6 records in the *Auto* data set within the `ISLR2` package.

```{r}
head(ISLR2::Auto)
```

Well, that was exciting!
